T1  - Thus the state of psychiatry today: the musicians do not play the same instrument, they could never form a symphony orchestra (who could agree on the conductor?), but there is not complete cacophony.

T1  - The science of mental disease, as it would develop in the asylum, would always be only of the order of observation and classification. It would not be a dialogue. It could not be that until psychoanalysis had exorcised this phenomenon of observation ... and substituted for its silent magic the powers of language.

KW  - Sophocles ; tragedy
T1  - It was above all Sophocles, the last great exponent of the archaic world-view, who expressed the full tragic significance of the old religious themes in their unsoftened, unmoralised forms--the overwhelming sense of human helplessness in the face of the divine mystery, and of the ate that waits on all human achievement--and who made these thoughts part of the cultural inheritance of Western Man.

T1  - Blessed is he whose life has not tasted of evil.
When God has shaken a house, the winds of madness
Lash its breed till the breed is done:
  Even so the deep-sea swell
  Raked by wicked Thracian winds
Scours in its running the subaqueous darkness,
Churns the silt black from sea-bottom;
And the windy cliffs roar as they take its shock.

Here on the Labdacid house long we watched it piling,
Trouble on dead men's trouble: no generation
Frees the next from the stroke of God:
  Deliverance does not come.
  The final branch of Oedipus
Grew in his house, and a lightness hung above it:
To-day they reap it with Death's red sickle,
The unwise mouth and the tempter who sits in the brain.

The power of God man's arrogance shall not limit:
Sleep who takes all in his net takes not this,
Nor the unflagging months of Heaven--ageless the Master
Holds for ever the shimmering courts of Olympus.
  For time approaching, and time hereafter,
  And time forgotten, one rule stands:
  That greatness never
Shall touch the life of man without destruction.

Hope goes fast and far: to many it carries comfort,
To many it is but the trick of light-witted desire--
Blind we walk, till the unseen flame has trapped our footsteps.
"Of a mind that God leads to destruction
  The sign is this--that in the end
  Its good is evil."
Not long shall that mind evade destruction.
