T1  - Thus the state of psychiatry today: the musicians do not play the same instrument, they could never form a symphony orchestra (who could agree on the conductor?), but there is not complete cacophony.

T1  - The science of mental disease, as it would develop in the asylum, would always be only of the order of observation and classification. It would not be a dialogue. It could not be that until psychoanalysis had exorcised this phenomenon of observation … and substituted for its silent magic the powers of language.

KW  - Sophocles ; tragedy
T1  - It was above all Sophocles, the last great exponent of the archaic world-view, who expressed the full tragic significance of the old religious themes in their unsoftened, unmoralised forms—the overwhelming sense of human helplessness in the face of the divine mystery, and of the ate that waits on all human achievement—and who made these thoughts part of the cultural inheritance of Western Man.

T1  - Blessed is he whose life has not tasted of evil.
T1  - When God has shaken a house, the winds of madness
T1  - Lash its breed till the breed is done:
T1  - Even so the deep-sea swell
T1  - Raked by wicked Thracian winds
T1  - Scours in its running the subaqueous darkness,
T1  - Churns the silt black from sea-bottom;
T1  - And the windy cliffs roar as they take its shock.

T1  - Here on the Labdacid house long we watched it piling,
T1  - Trouble on dead men’s trouble: no generation
T1  - Frees the next from the stroke of God:
T1  - Deliverance does not come.
T1  - The final branch of Oedipus
T1  - Grew in his house, and a lightness hung above it:
T1  - To-day they reap it with Death’s red sickle,
T1  - The unwise mouth and the tempter who sits in the brain.
T1  - 
T1  - The power of God man’s arrogance shall not limit:
T1  - Sleep who takes all in his net takes not this,
T1  - Nor the unflagging months of Heaven—ageless the Master
T1  - Holds for ever the shimmering courts of Olympus.
T1  - For time approaching, and time hereafter,
T1  - And time forgotten, one rule stands:
T1  - That greatness never
T1  - Shall touch the life of man without destruction.
T1  - 
T1  - Hope goes fast and far: to many it carries comfort,
T1  - To many it is but the trick of light-witted desire—
T1  - Blind we walk, till the unseen flame has trapped our footsteps.
T1  - “Of a mind that God leads to destruction
T1  - The sign is this—that in the end
T1  - Its good is evil.”
T1  - Not long shall that mind evade destruction.

T1  - There is a spectrum of ways to understand Bolzano’s achievement. … (I) Balzano firmly established a theorem that was not known to be true until his proof. … (II) Bolzano’s proof explained the theorem. … (III) The theorem confirmed the premises of the proof. … The consequence of adopting (III) is highly significant for our view of pictures. We can draw the moral quickly: on this view {pictures are crucial}.
