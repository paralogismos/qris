# Qris

## A Simple Tool for Creating RIS Files

Qris is designed to process files containing annotated quotations into a RIS format suitable for import into [EndNote](https://support.clarivate.com/Endnote/). This allows a user to create and maintain, with a text editor or word processor, quote files which may later be processed and easily imported.

The tool can accept either `.txt` or `.docx` files as input. The input files may contain any number of source citations, and each source may be associated with any number of quotes. Each quote is processed into a RIS citation record; the RIS records are collected into `.ris` output files.

The current input annotation format is specific to a particular use case, but this may become configurable in the future.

See the [Qris Wiki](https://github.com/paralogismos/qris/wiki) for more detailed information.
