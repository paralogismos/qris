T1  - There is a spectrum of ways to understand Bolzano’s achievement. … (I) Balzano firmly established a theorem that was not known to be true until his proof. … (II) Bolzano’s proof explained the theorem. … (III) The theorem confirmed the premises of the proof. … The consequence of adopting (III) is highly significant for our view of pictures. We can draw the moral quickly: on this view {pictures are crucial}.

T1  - I should add that the way the picture works is much like a direct perception; it is not some sort of encoded argument.

T1  - Let us call any evidence which falls short of an actual traditional proof, ‘inductive evidence’. Mathematical achievements may rest entirely on deductive evidence, but mathematical practice is based squarely on the inductive kind. Let’s look briefly at some types. … Enumerative induction: … Analogy: … Broad experience:…

T1  - [T]he inferring of premises from consequences is the essence of induction; thus the method of investigating the principles of mathematics is really an inductive method, and is substantially the same as the method of discovering general laws in any other science (Russell [1907], pp. 273f.)

T1  - ‘The minimal commonality between pictorial form and object is logical form’ [Tractatus, 2.18]. What this suggests is a kind of structural similarity, a notion which is captured by the concept of an isomorphism.

T1  - As a ‘picture’, it represents Napoleon; as a ‘symbol’ it represents leadership, courage, adventure. The painting simultaneously manages to be about something concrete and something abstract.

T1  - If we consider a surface, the intrinsic features are those which characterize the surface independently of any particular coordinatization. By contrast, the extrinsic features depend on particular coordinate systems, and change with a change of coordinates. The connection between them is this: an intrinsic feature corresponds to the existence of a coordinate system with specific appropriate extrinsic features.(7)
