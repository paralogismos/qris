This typological change in place will have socioeconomic consequences and prompt the partnership of Friedrich Engels with Karl Marx in discussions of labor and economy.

T1  - "The picture put forward here is compatible with the global workspace theory of consciousness of Bernard Baars (1988) and the dispositional higher-order thought theory of Peter Carruthers (2000a). Carruthers puts the theory forward as a theory of phenomenal consciousness where availability of the contents of consciousness to higher-order thought or theory of mind resources give the contents their phenomenal character. ... Carruthers also adheres to a Fodorian version of modular theory of mind, but I think that the same cognitive architecture is available for a less radical non-modular version of mind that nevertheless takes seriously the idea of cerebral specialisation even though it is not possible to give a constant and exact distribution for the specialisation."

If fully and consistently developed, the trend in question leads to a psychology not only without 'soul' but also without consciousness.

T1  - Eighteen years after Cassirer, the physicist Arthur Eddington pointed out the fundamental importance of the structural approach in physics, and, in this context, he worked out the decisive function of the group concept: "Physical science consists of purely structural knowledge, so that we know only the structure of the universe which it describes. This is not a conjecture as to the nature of physical knowledge; it is precisely what physical knowledge as formulated in present-day theory states itself to be. In fundamental investigations the conception of group-structure appears quite explicitly as the starting point, and nowhere in the subsequent development do we admit material not derived from groupstructure.

T1  - My investigations on spatial intuitions in the field of vision induced me also to start investigations on the question of the origin and essential nature of our general intuitions of space. The question which then forced itself upon me, and one which also obviously belongs to the domain of the exact sciences, was at first only the following: how much of the propositions of geometry has an objectively valid sense? And how much is on the contrary only definition or the consequence of definitions, or depends on the form of description? In my opinion, this question is not to be answered all that simply. For in geometry we deal constantly with ideal structures, whose corporeal portrayal in the actual world is always only an approximation to what the concept demands, and we only decide whether a body is fixed, its sides flat and its edges straight, by means of the very propositions whose factual correctness the examination is supposed to show.

(1) the discovery by analysis of the basic theoretical root of the problem;
(2) the selection of the simplest phenomenon exhibiting the factors involved in the difficulty;
(3) the inductive observation of these relevant factors;
(4) the projection of relevant hypotheses suggested by these relevant facts;
(5) the deduction of logical consequences from each hypothesis, thereby permitting it to be put to an experimental test;
(6) the clarification of one's initial problem in the light of the verified hypothesis; and
(7) the generalization of one's solution by means of a pursuit of the logical implications of the new concepts and theory with respect to other subject matter and applications.

T1  - The beginnings of it [constantly increasing self-sufficiency of pure projective thinking] were already evident in the seventeenth century, with Desargues and Pascal, but the process attained full maturity and a consciousness of its methodological independence only with Poncelet, who first set up a program for a geometry that was based no longer on ideas of size and measure but on the concept and the study of pure relationship of position. His Traite des proprietes projectives des figures (18~~) was significant not only from a mathematical but from a general epistemological standpoint as well, because he adopted Leibniz' principle of continuity and sought to give it validity in a new way, by introducing into geometry the idea of the imaginary.

T1  - Ramachandran and Hirstein (1999) also include the problem of genericity and non-genericity in their principles underlying artistic expression and experience. However, they reach exactly the opposite conclusion from mine here, namely, that artists in general avoid the "suspicious coincidences" displayed in non-generic viewpoints, since they hinder automatic object recognition. This is wrong on a purely empirical basis: artists massively resort to non-generic viewpoints and configurations in order to morphologically enhance the saliency of their paintings. It is furthermore wrong for reasons that could be revealed by an ad absurdum argument: applied to language, their argument would indeed imply that since as a rule humans avoid syntactic, semantic, phonetic, and prosodic oddities in their language use, in order not to hinder the automatic recognition of the communicated meaning, then such oddities are also carefully avoided in the poetic use of language. Eventually, the argument is also wrong for a somewhat deeper reason: the authors do not seem to operate with the essential distinction between conceptual and non-conceptual significations. This distinction is key in Husserl's phenomenology, where it concerns the huge program of founding conceptual-logical structures on pre-conceptual, intuitive meanings. It is nowadays the cornerstone in Jean Petitot's impressive work in morphodynamic semiotics, the neuroscience of vision as well as aesthetic inquiries.
